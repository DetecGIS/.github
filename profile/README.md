# DetecGIS
## Introduction

DetecGIS is a Windows Desktop application attempting to bring streamlined research and documentation software to amateur archeologists. The application allows users to upload and store data for artifacts and sites they have discovered and provides a powerful set of features to document, interact, and interpret this data. Large data sets are stored on the DetecGIS servers, allowing users to avoid storing and self-managing large files while enabling them to load and access their data in real time. DetecGIS is the starting point for a long-term project aiming to make powerful visualization tools and machine learning resources available for amateur archeologists.
