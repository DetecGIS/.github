## Introduction

DetecGIS is a Windows Desktop application that attempts to bring streamlined research and documentation software to amateur archaeologists. The application allows users to upload and store data for artifacts and sites they have discovered and provides a powerful set of features to document, interact with, and interpret this data. DetecGIS is the starting point for a long-term project to make powerful visualization and documentation tools accessible to amateur archeologists.
